To test out the difference between dumb(ASis) and smart(active learning) run:

    python3.13 -B extend.py data/optimize/config/*.csv

To run the tests:

    python3 tests.py

To run part1 of the experiment do:

    python3.13 -B extend3.py -t data/optimize/config/SS-T.csv //here filename can be replaced with any of the files

We have used makefile to run the same command for all of the large files and store their outputs
To run part2 of the experiment there is a makefile create. to generate the outputs:
    make Act=branch outputs

Go to path to view the outputs:

    cd ~/tmp/branch/outputs
    ls

for some reason the rq.sh did not work and showed "Column: line too long"
I have copy pasted the output files from the tmp directory to result directory. To view the summary, I have translated the rq.sh into summary.py. to get the summary:

    cd result //considering you are in home directory
    python3 summary.py
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8265b53e-29c2-4953-a838-50e3627c255a)


I have captured the output in output.txt file
    cat output.txt

Optional :
    To see why rq.sh is not working. You can back into cd ~/tmp/branch/outputs run bash /ezr/process_csv.sh(relative path might be different in codespaces. It's basically in the root directory)
